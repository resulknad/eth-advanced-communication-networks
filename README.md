## Overview

We use a centralized controller that computes paths through a series of **multi-commodity flow (MCF)** problems.
The user selects a subset of the SLAs, which give rise to a set of (base traffic) flows that must be considered.
The simulation is divided into fixed-size intervals of a few seconds length.
For each interval, the controller constructs an MCF problem consisting of the relevant base traffic flows.
This global view allows us to approximate an optimal solution.
The MCF problems are solved by means of Linear Programming, and the solutions are then converted into paths and installed on the switches.

In the forwarding plane, paths are added to the packets at the ingress switches in the form of an **MPLS header stack**.
Forwarding is based on these labels, except for the last hop, which is IPv4 based.
Packets that do not belong to an installed path are dropped at the ingress switch.

The above approach is complemented by the following techniques:
- **Failure detection**: Link state changes are detected using heartbeats and trigger a recomputation of the MCF solution.
- **Additional Traffic**: If enabled, the switches detect additional traffic and forward it to the controller, which can then decide to install an appropriate path on the switch if the residual graph has sufficient capacity.
- **Load balancing**: When the MCF solution distributes a flow among multiple paths, the ingress switch chooses a path uniformly at random at flowlet granularity. For UDP, every packet is considered its own flowlet.

# Additional Information

## Linear Program Formulation
### Mutli-Commodity Flow Problem
We start by defining what a multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem on a directed graph $`G = (V,E)`$ is.

For each edge $`e \in E`$, we have some non-negative capacity $`c(e) = c(u,v)`$.

Furthermore, we have $`k`$ commodities, each of them defined by the 4-tuple $`K_i = (s_i, t_i, d_i, p_i)`$, where $`s_i`$ is the source, $`t_i`$ the sink, $`d_i`$ the demand and $`p_i: E \rightarrow R`$ the commodity's cost function describing the cost of sending some amount of flow over a specific edge. We will denote the actual flow of commodity $`i`$ on edge $`e=(u,v)`$ as $`f_i(u,v)`$.

So intuitively, having a commodity $`K_i`$ requires a flow of $`d_i`$ units from source $`s_i`$ to $`t_i`$, while for every link we need to obey the capacity constraints.

This intuition translates to the following constrained optimization problem to minimize the total cost for all flows:

**Objective:**

```math
\min \sum_{i \in K} \sum_{(u,v) \in E} f_i(u,v) \cdot p_i(u,v)
```
where $`K = \{1, \ldots, k\}`$.

**Constraints:**

1. **Link capacity:**
$`\forall (u,v) \in E: \sum_{i \in K} f_i(u,v) \leq c(u,v)`$

2. **Flow conservation (transit nodes):**
$`\forall i \in K: \sum_{w\in V} f_i(u,w) - \sum_{w \in V} f_i(w,u) = 0 \text{ when } u \neq s_i, t_i`$

3. **Flow conservation (source node)**
$`\forall i \in K: \sum_{w\in V} f_i(s_i,w) - \sum_{w \in V} f_i(w,s_i) = d_i`$

4. **Flow conservation (sink node)**
$`\forall i \in K: \sum_{w\in V} f_i(t_i,w) - \sum_{w \in V} f_i(w,t_i) = -d_i`$


If we constrain our solutions to have a single flow per commodity, i.e., $`f_i: E \rightarrow \{0,d_i\}`$, then the MCF problem is NP-complete. This is referred to as the decision version of the problem. If we allow fractional flows, i.e., $`f_i: E \rightarrow [0,d_i]`$, the constraints of a single commodity might be satisfied by using multiple paths, but the problem can then be solved in polynomial time using linear programming.

### Linear Program (LP)
The above constraints translate in a straightforward manner to a linear program. Simply introduce a variable for each $`f_i(u,v)`$ and allow it to be fractional. Note that for any feasible solution, for all commodities $`i`$ and all edges $`e`$ we have $`f_i(e) = f_i(u,v) \leq d_i`$ by constraint (2, 3 and 4). The intuition here is that if the flow was larger at any point, then it would also have to be larger everywhere in the flow (flow conservation) and thus also at the source and sink where it would violate both constraints 3 and 4.

The number of constraints and variables is in $`O(k\cdot m)`$ where $`m`$ is the number of edges and $`k`$ the number of commodities.

### Excess / Slack
So far, the LP is feasible only if all of the commodities' demands can be satisfied. Since we are also interested in a solution satisfying only a part of our requirements, we introduce slack variables (edges) to our LP (as in [1]).

For every commodity, we add an edge $`(s_i, t_i)`$ with infinite capacity and cost $`p_i(s_i,t_i) = \infty`$. Now our LP is always feasible, but it will only use those excess edges as a last resort due to the huge cost.

### Mapping flows to LPs
We start with the graph $`G`$ as defined in our network topology. The capacity of every edge is given by the bandwidth defined in the toplogy. Let us now show how some TCP flow `shost:sport -> dhost:dport` with demand $`d`$ is represented in our MCF problem:

For both flow endpoints (`shost:sport:TCP`) and (`dhost:dport:TCP`), we add a new node to our graph, each connected to the respective host node (`shost`) and (`dhost`) with infinite capacity and zero cost edges.

We then need two commodities:

```math
s_i = \text{shost:sport:TCP} \\
t_i = \text{dhost:dport:TCP} \\
d_i = d \\
p_i(u,v) = \textit{cost\_multiplier} \cdot \textit{delay(u,v)}
```

and

```math
s_{i+1} = \text{dhost:dport:TCP}\\
t_{i+1} = \text{shost:sport:TCP}\\
d_{i+1} = d\cdot \textit{TCP\_ack\_factor}\\
p_{i+1}(u,v) = \textit{cost\_multiplier} \cdot \textit{delay(u,v)}
```

Note that we reduce the bandwidth of the reverse flow by the $`\textit{TCP\_ack\_factor} = 0.5`$ because the acknowledgements require less bandwidth than the transfer flow itself. 

The parameter $`\textit{cost\_multiplier}`$ allows to incentivize solutions which have smaller delays for certain flows. It may make sense to set the cost multiplier to some high value for flows which have associated delay SLAs which we are trying to fulfill.

Note that for UDP flows we do the same exact thing, but without the reverse direction commodity.

### Waypointing
We may directly add waypointing as a further constraint to our LP. Let us assume we want to waypoint some commodity $`(s_i,t_i,d_i,p_i)`$ to route via waypoint $`w`$.

The requirement is simple: every flow in our solution for commodity $`i`$ must go through $`w`$.

For this we split the commodity $`i`$ into two commodities $`j`$ and $`j+1`$:

```math
K_j = (s_i, w, d_i, p_i) \text{ and } K_{j+1} = (w, t_i, d_i, p_i)
```

To prevent a situation where we have a flow from $`s_i`$ to the waypoint $`w`$ but cannot reach $`t_i`$ from there because $`K_{j+1}`$ could not be satisfied, we add a constraint on the excess variables:

```math
\textit{excess}_j = \textit{excess}_{j+1}
```

This ensures that in every feasible solution if we have a flow of $`x`$ units from $`s_i`$ to $`w`$, we also have a flow of $`x`$ units from $`w`$ to $`t_i`$.

### Fractional Flows
Our solution might return fractional flows. This means for some flow we might have multiple paths, each taking a different fraction of the flow.
We load balance across those paths by selecting one uniformly at random an the ingress switch. This selection is performed at a flowlet granularity for TCP flows and at a packet granularity for UDP flows.

While this might not respect the exact fractional solutions derived in our LP, experimental evidence suggests that this is not a big problem.
